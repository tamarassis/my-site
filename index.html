 which was destroyed in 1671 by the Welsh privateer Henry Morgan. It is located in the suburbs <br>
 of the current capital. Together with the historical district of Panamá, it has been a World Heritage Site since 1997.

 and culture. This destination is perfect for a visit on  streets,<br>
 historic buildings and colorful doors make all visitors fall in love.</p>

 the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,<br>
 enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous routearound the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage. </p>
